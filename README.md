Term Project for CSC690, App Development (iOS): a Swift app that finds the median point between two distances and displays a TableView of restaurants by top rated reviews.

#### Must Have Feautures:
1) User shall type two locations and then the median point is marked.
2) A TableView shall appear that lists restaurants by top rated Yelp reviews. User can navigate back to the Map view using a back button.

#### Nice to Have Feautures:
1) The app could be more general and include different criteria such as 'Drinks' and 'Entertainment.'
2) The map would display the median point AND sub-median points (a total of 3 points).
3) User could adjust the radius range.
4) Everytime the map opens, it would open to the user's current location, (as of 4/14/18, the Bay Area's coordinates are hardcoded in).

#### Tasks:
2) Display location A and B textfields and 'Dine' button asset over GoogleMaps view.
3) Implement method that takes in locations A and B and returns the median distance.
4) Implement Yelp API.
5) Make Yelp TableView with button to go back to Map view.
##### If there's time:
6) Make circular thumbnails of three restaurants that appear over the median point in the Map view.
